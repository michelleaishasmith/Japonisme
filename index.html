                    On this page I will be discussing the essay by The MET on Japonisme. “Japonisme is a term first used by the French which described the craze for Japanese art and design in the west”(1). In particular I will be talking about the styles that have appeared through the introduction of Japanese art. First, I will introduce how Japanese art was brought to the west, how the west was influenced and what new styles and techniques were born.

                    The west were first introduced to Japanese art works through the "reopening of ports in 1853". (2) Japanese art was a lot different to western artworks. In particular, Japanese pieces had very consistent oriental themes and subjects within their work. An example of this is a geisha, as we can see on the image to the right, by Kitagawa Utamaro. Other themes and subjects included “kimonos and conspicuous displays of oriental props” (2). However, even though the essay discusses how some artists also used the same Japanese objects in their replication of the style, others did not. Some artists avoided using the same subjects and focused on the style of the paintings themselves. According to Edgar Degas Japanese paintings are often “elongated pictorial formats, asymmetrical compositions, aerial perspective, spaces emptied of all but abstract elements of color and line, and a focus on singularly decorative motifs”.(2)</p>

                <p>From this essay, it seems as there were many thoughts and opinions regarding the new Japanese art that flooded onto western shores. Mary Cassatt explained that Japanese art was a “a fresh approach to the depiction of common events in women’s lives” (2). After reading this quote and looking at the pictures of Japanese inspired works, I can understand this statement. When looking at the different paintings of Japanese women, I see a very simple style used to depict the face. The color schemes the Japanese used Included very nude and neutral colors, which also adds to a fresh aesthetic. Women in Japanese artworks are all very elegantly posed and positioned in whatever situation they are painted in.

                <p>As I take a look at Mary Cassatts work above I can clearly see how she has been influenced by Japanese artworks. First, we can see the subject of a woman, holding a baby. The colors used are muted creams, browns and nudes, followed by a plain textured background. The strokes she uses are very fine, which gives this piece a very delicate look. We can definitely see this fine detail within the hair, which adds a touch of reality amongst the simplicity that surrounds the mother and baby. Another similarity this work and Japanese art work share is the simplicity of the facial features.

                    Overall this essay discusses how Japanese artwork had influenced western art in the 19th century in many ways. Some artists were influenced by the subjects, but some were influenced by their style and techniques. Paintings of this era did come out more exotic looking but also followed this effortless, simple style of the Japanese. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the ports opened more exotic, unfamiliar things came across to the west. It is this mystery and the idea of something from a far away land which makes something more appealing. I believe this is because foreign items are rarer and therefore have increased value. By implementing the aesthetics or techniques of something from over shores, recreates the excitement. A style that has been overused, no longer sparks curiosity or interest. Although, the Japanese artworks that were introduced were completely new to people, the influence of both west and Japanese works also created something entirely new. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, the influence of new things, I believe changes art in a good way. We are at a time were almost everything has been done before. A good example of this is fashion and how we keep bringing back fashion trends from the past to turn them in to something new. Even today, we are still being influenced by so many different cultures, since they are so accessible. Being exposed to new, unfamiliar things, only makes us what to recreate this feeling of excitement all over again.
